# Toggl Backend Unattended Programming Test

_March 6th 2020_

_This an initial project as part of a job interview at toggl.
The test consists of a simple API backend to be written in Go.
The test should be completed in three hours._

> ‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
> The goal of the programming test is to create an API that can create decks of playing cards.
> Those decks of cards can be requested and viewed.
> Additionally, cards can be drawn from a deck - removing the card from it and leaving fewer remaining cards in the deck.
> ‚ô†Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è - [`full specification`](./spec.pdf)

## Usage ‚ö°Ô∏è

> The current API is live at [`toggl.janniks.com/ping`](https://toggl.janniks.com/ping)

The API structure is very simple:
```
GET  /ping                # pong
POST /deck                # create new deck (optional parameters: cards, shuffle)
GET  /deck/:deck_id       # fetch deck by id
GET  /deck/:deck_id/draw  # draw cards from deck (optional parameters: count)
```

_The exact usage can be inspected via the [`api.postman_collection.json`](./api.postman_collection.json) postman collection._

## Run üõ†

> All commands are to be run from the root project directory.
> This project uses Go version `1.14`.
> Current `go` executables should detect and install dependencies correctly.
> Set `GIN_MODE` to `release` for production deploys.

To manually install dependencies run:
```
go get -d -v ./...
go install -v ./...
```

To start the complete API run:
```
go run initial.go
```

To test all available test files run:
```
go test -v ./...
```

> Additionally, a [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) is provided that will run anywhere Docker runs.

## Preparation üìö

This is the first [Go](https://golang.org/) project that I worked on. To prepare, I went through the following resources beforehand

- I read through [Learn Go in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/go/) which gave me a super quick and dirty introduction to Go
- I followed the project structuring guidelines of [How to Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html)
- I quickly read over the most import idioms and patterns of Go at [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- I also chose [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) as an IDE and went through their onboarding tutorial

To choose a backend framework and ORM I simply launched a few Google searches.
Go offers many promising solutions, but I chose one of the most popular (although lacking documentation) frameworks [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) along with [GORM](https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm).

## Experience üé°

The code itself is fairly self-documenting and was super fun to write.

Using Go, Gin, and GORM was fairly straight-forward and I could get going very quickly.
GoLand was also a great choice with many cool features and tricks (like [postfix completions](https://twitter.com/golandide/status/991301502449963009)). 

I chose SQLite as a file database (perfect for a proof-of-concept project) which can easily be replaced by any other SQL-type database without any logic changes.

The actual data being stored for cards in a deck is simply an `integer` array.
The `integer` values are converted to cards (with values and suits) during runtime.

The only notable problems I encountered are listed in the subsequent pitfalls section.
Due to the time constraint, I was not able to complete all planned refactoring. For example, the [`initial_test.go`](./initial_test.go) API test file is not very DRY. Additionally, there are some test cases and parameter edge cases that were missed and could cause unexpected behavior.

## Pitfalls ‚ö†Ô∏è

- No generics in Go üò± _(somewhat annoying due to other issues mentioned below)_
- Constraints to certain data-types due to lack of support in GORM ([gorm#1588](https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm/issues/1588)) lead to some lost time.
- Testing best practices are not very clear/defined in the Go community. Auto-generated code was often very different from the sample code of multiple projects.
- Now knowing what I learned through this project, I would start writing tests and API validation first. Go/Gin was very new to me which lead me to change project structures a couple of times and made true TDD a bit difficult. 

## Roadmap üöß

_There's still some stuff that I'd like to continue_

- DRY repeated code blocks (`db` fetching, http requests in tests, etc.)
- Simplify conversion of card `id` to `code` and vice-versa
- Add more tests

## Feedback üí¨

If you notice anything in this repository - bad code style, bad practices, bugs, very wet code, etc. - please let me know! I enjoyed this project in Go and would like to learn more üôè
